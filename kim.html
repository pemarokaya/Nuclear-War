        <p> Kim Jong-un or Kim Jong Un (Chosŏn'gŭl: 김정은; Korean pronunciation: [kim.dzɔŋ.ɯn]; born 8 January 1982–84 or 5 July 1984) is the Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and supreme leader of North Korea since 2011. Kim is the second child of Kim Jong-il (1941–2011) and Ko Yong-hui. He is the first North Korean leader to have been born after the country's founding. Before taking power, Kim was rarely seen in public, and many of the activities of Kim and his government remain unknown. <br>
        Kim has vowed to launched nuclear attacks across the world in retaliation to the new UN sanctions against North Korea. In recent times they launched a missile over Japan and also threatened to launch bombs on the US territory of Guam.</p>
